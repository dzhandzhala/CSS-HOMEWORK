		<h2>On the Verge of Insanity</h2>
		<p class="art-text">Vincent cut off his left ear on 23 December 1888. It was the first of several serious breakdowns that plagued him until his tragic suicide a year and a half later. We don’t know precisely what his illness was, but it had a huge impact on him.</p>
		<p class="name">Ward in the Hospital in Arles <br>January 1889</p>

	    <h2 class="love-title">Love for sale</h2>
		<p class="art-text">Vincent was raised in a middle-class home and learned to distinguish between two types of women. Ladies from his own class were viewed as ‘higher beings’, while he felt pity for socially disadvantaged women such as prostitutes.Like his contemporary modern artists, however, it was precisely the latter type of women that he liked to draw and paint.</p>

	  <h2 class="contrast-title">Looking for contrast</h2>
	  <p class="art-text">When you think of Vincent van Gogh, you think of bright, intense colours. Yet his palette wasn’t always so vivid. If we compare Vincent’s first still lifes with his later masterpieces, we see a quest, in which his colours changed from dark to bright.</p>
